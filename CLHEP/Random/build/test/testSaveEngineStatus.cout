             Part I 
Original tests of static save/restore
=====================================

Using old method or HepRandom::saveEngineStatus:
All these tests should have a chance of failure.
HepJamesRandomHepJamesRandomr(1) = -0.876598
r(2) = -1.40295
r(3) = -0.0889336
r1005= 0.704778
restored r(2) = -0.0889336
THIS DOES NOT MATCH REMEMBERED VALUE BUT THAT IS EXPECTED
restored r(3) = 0.17825
restored r1005= -0.308614
THIS DOES NOT MATCH REMEMBERED VALUE BUT THAT IS EXPECTED
r(1) = 1
r(2) = 0
r(3) = 1
r1005= 1
restored r(2) = 0
restored r(3) = 1
restored r1005= 0
THIS DOES NOT MATCH REMEMBERED VALUE BUT THAT IS EXPECTED
Using the class-specific RandGauss::saveEngineStatus:
All these tests should work properly.
r(1) = 0.562165
r(2) = -0.0523297
r(3) = -0.0343245
r1005= -0.778849
restored r(2) = -0.0523297
restored r(3) = -0.0343245
restored r1005= -0.778849
r(1) = 1
r(2) = 0
r(3) = 0
r1005 = 0
r1006 = 1
r1007 = 0
restored r(2) = 0
restored r(3) = 0
restored r1005= 0
restored r1006= 1
restored r1007= 0

=============================================

testSaveEngineStatus passed with no problems detected.
